## Configuration

SWAG proxy-confs files can be found here on github : https://github.com/linuxserver/reverse-proxy-confs

* The main site configuration is in the site-confs folder.
* The active-confs folder is for subfolder children sites. Rename .sample files and place them here to explicitly enable their configration blocks.
* The default configuration is for a single site. If you want to add more sites, you can copy the default configuration and modify it to suit your needs.
